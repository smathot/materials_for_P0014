In Exp. 1, the memory-match probe was task-irrelevant and presented in peripheral vision; therefore, the memory-match probe could be ignored by narrowing the focus of attention to the fixation point. This 'attentional tunnel vision' may have prevented the probe from capturing attention [cf. @Theeuwes1991]. To control for this, we repeated the experiment, but added catch trials in which the probes were task-relevant; therefore, participants could no longer use attentional tunnel vision, and the memory-match probe should capture attention if it has the potential to do so.

## Methods

The methods were similar to those of Exp. 1 with the following differences.

Fifteen participants were recruited (7 women; age rage 18-26; normal or normal-to corrected vision).

Stimuli were presented on a 24" LG 24MB65PM monitor (1280 x 800 px, 60 Hz). As a consequence, stimuli were scaled by 95% compared with Exp. 1.

One out of every nine trials was a catch trial, in which the probes abruptly changed to patches of white noise at an unpredictable moment during the retention interval. One probe changed 83 ms before the other probe. The participant indicated which probe changed first by pressing the right (right first) or left (left first) key.

The experiment was conducted in two sessions on separate days. Each session consisted of 27 practice trials, followed by 82 experimental trials, and took Â±1 h.

## Results

### Trial-exclusion criteria

Trials were discarded when horizontal gaze deviation during the retention interval exceeded the maximum displacement of the central gradient (5.1%; see Methods: Procedure). Due to a technical issue, manual responses were not logged for some trials; these were excluded (2.2%). No participants were excluded. In total, 2,254 trials remained for further analysis.

### Behavioral results

For regular trials, accuracy was 73.3% (SE = 1.6), and mean correct RT was 2.3 s (SE = 0.2). For catch trials, accuracy was 68.5% (SE = 3.8), and mean correct RT was 1.0 s (SE = 0.1).

### Pupil-size results

%FigPupilTrace::b shows pupil size over time as a function of Probe Brightness (regular trials only). The results are very similar to those of Exp. 1. Crucially, we again found that the pupil was larger when the probe appeared on a bright, compared to a dark, background. This effect was reliable from 810 - 1220 ms.

## Eye-movement results

As in Exp. 1, we analyzed gaze deviation in the untrimmed data. A Bayesian t-test revealed strong evidence for a deviation toward the memory-match probe (BF = 27.0). (For reference, a classical one-sided paired-samples t-test revealed the same bias: t(14) = 3.5, p = .002)

### Discussion

Exp. 2 was a near-perfect replication of Exp. 1. We again found that the eyes were initially drawn toward the probe that matched the content of visual working memory. And, again, we found no evidence for a sustained bias of attention toward the probe that matched the content of visual working memory. Rather, we observed the opposite pattern: When the memory-match probe was presented on a bright background, the pupil was larger than when it was presented on a dark background. Together, this suggests that the memory-match probe briefly captured attention, but was inhibited later in time.
