In Exp. 1, the memory-matching probe was task-irrelevant and positioned in the periphery; therefore, the memory-matching probe could be ignore by narrowing the focus of attention to the fixation point. This 'attentional tunnel vision' may have prevented the probe from capturing attention [cf. @Theeuwes1991]. To control for this, we repeated the experiment, but added catch trials in which the probes were task relevant. Therefore, participants could no longer use attentional tunnel vision, and the memory-matching probe should capture attention if it has the potential to do so.

## Methods

The methods were similar to those of Experiment 1. All differences are indicated below.

### Participants

Fifteen participants were recruited (7 women; age rage 18-26; normal or normal-to corrected vision).

### Software and equipment

Stimuli were presented on a 24" LG 24MB65PM monitor (1280 x 800 px, 60 Hz).

### Procedure

One out of every nine trials was a catch trial, in which the probes abruptly changed to patches of white noise at an unpredictable moment during the retention interval. One probe changed 83 ms before the other probe. The participant's task was to indicate which probe changed first by pressing the right (right first) or left (left first) key.

Stimuli were scaled by 95% compared with Exp. 1 (because of a changed monitor).

## Results

### Trial-exclusion criteria

Trials were discarded when horizontal gaze deviation during the retention interval exceeded the maximum displacement of the central gradient (5.1%; see Methods: Procedure). Due to a technical issue, manual responses were not logged for some trials; these were excluded (2.2Â°). No participants were excluded. In total, 2,254 trials remained for further analysis.

### Behavioral results

For regular trials, accuracy was 73.3% (SE = 1.6), and mean correct RT was 2.3 s (SE = 0.2). For catch trials, accuracy was 68.5% (SE = 3.8), and mean correct RT was 1.0 s (SE = 0.1).

### Pupil-size results

%FigPupilTrace::b shows pupil size over time as a function of Probe Brightness (regular trials only). The results are very similar to those of Experiment 1. Crucially, we found again that the pupil was larger when the probe appeared on a bright, compared to a dark, background. This effect was reliable from 810 - 1220 ms.

### Discussion

In Exp. 2, we again failed to find pupillary evidence that attention was captured by the memory-matching probe. Rather, we observed the opposite pattern: When the memory-match probe was presented on a bright background, the pupil was larger than when it was presented on a dark background. This suggests that attention was biased away from, rather than toward, the memory-match probe.
