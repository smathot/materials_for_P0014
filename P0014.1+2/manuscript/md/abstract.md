When you keep a red apple in working memory, your attention is usually--but not always--attracted by other red objects. The conditions under which the contents of visual working memory guide visual attention are still unclear. Here we tested whether attention is indeed biased toward memory-match stimuli, and, if so, whether this bias is transient or sustained. We used a new pupillometric technique, which exploits that the pupil is larger when you covertly attend to dark, compared to bright, stimuli. This allowed us to test whether and when attention was biased toward memory-match stimuli, by placing them either on a dark or bright background, while measuring pupil size over time. We found that the eyes were briefly captured by memory-match probes. However, the pupillary data suggested that there was no sustained attention bias toward memory-match probes later in time; rather, attention appeared to be biased away from them. In line with multi-state models of working memory, we suggest that working-memory items capture attention when they are in a special 'prioritized' state, but that items may be put in an 'accessory' state, in which case they do not capture attention, and may even be inhibited.
